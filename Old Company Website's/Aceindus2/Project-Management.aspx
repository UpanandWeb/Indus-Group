                    Increasingly demanding customers and a constantly changing competitive landscape require evolving technology capabilities. But system upgrades and new-legacy integration projects can distract already depleted IT departments from their core mission, and specific skill sets to get the job done may not be available internally. To make matters worse, stringent time constraints have to be respected if your firm is to reap all the benefits of technological innovation — that is, before your competitors complete their own project.
